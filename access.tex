\begin{abstract}

%for = because :"He found it increasingly difficult to read, for his eyesight was beginning to fail"
For volatile and uncertain energy sources that generated from renewable energy sources (RES) depend on weather conditions, these sources are dispatched limited. Energy energy storage (ESS) can make the RES more ‘‘dispatch-able and reliable.

% generally causes a dynamic of transmission systems. Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES), combining RES and traditional energy resources as well as energy storage systems (ESS), need to indicate the optimal battery size in order to yield the highest profit. This research proposes the optimal model determining the size of ESS with optimizing the cost deviation, enabling the state of yielding profit gain for operating systems. Indeed, we focus on determining the optimal size of ESS, which maximizes real-time dispatch profit and reduces the deviation of fluctuating RES subject to forecasting errors. In addition, we detail analysis of the number of window side(s) of forecasting techniques by examining using a simple exponential smoothing (SES) model.


A xxxxx method is proposed to determine optimal size of ESS for volatile energy that generated from RES in electricity markets. The results indicate that the proposed xxxxx and xxxxx method is efficient to find optimal size of ESS.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{a1.png}}]{First A. Author} (M'76--SM'81--F'87) and all authors may include 
biographies. Biographies are often not included in conference-related
papers. This author became a Member (M) of IEEE in 1976, a Senior
Member (SM) in 1981, and a Fellow (F) in 1987. The first paragraph may
contain a place and/or date of birth (list place, then date). Next,
the author's educational background is listed. The degrees should be
listed with type of degree in what field, which institution, city,
state, and country, and year the degree was earned. The author's major
field of study should be lower-cased. 

The second paragraph uses the pronoun of the person (he or she) and not the 
author's last name. It lists military and work experience, including summer 
and fellowship jobs. Job titles are capitalized. The current job must have a 
location; previous positions may be listed 
without one. Information concerning previous publications may be included. 
Try not to list more than three books or published articles. The format for 
listing publishers of a book within the biography is: title of book 
(publisher name, year) similar to a reference. Current and previous research 
interests end the paragraph. The third paragraph begins with the author's 
title and last name (e.g., Dr.\ Smith, Prof.\ Jones, Mr.\ Kajor, Ms.\ Hunter). 
List any memberships in professional societies other than the IEEE. Finally, 
list any awards and work for IEEE committees and publications. If a 
photograph is provided, it should be of good quality, and 
professional-looking. Following are two examples of an author's biography.
